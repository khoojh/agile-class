Hello! this is my first document written in Markdown, and I am writing this for a class name Agile Software Development! 

I am attaching a [link](https://www.codementor.io/npostolovski/40-side-project-ideas-for-software-engineers-g8xckyxef) here, giving 40 side project ideas for software engineers! Click on the link if you are interested! Some of the projects provide tutorials, for example, HTTP server project have a link to tutorial available on the web. Feel free to check it out! As we know, the only way to become better at coding is through more practice! I had started coding pretty late, and did not realize the importance of more practice until later. Hence, I am writing to encourage more people to practice!
